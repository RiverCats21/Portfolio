      <h2>Professional Overview</h2>
      <p>
        I am a construction management and facilities engineering professional with a strong foundation in civil
        engineering principles and a growing focus on how artificial intelligence and data analytics can improve
        decision‑making across the built environment. My academic and professional experiences span cost estimating,
        scheduling, facilities planning, and infrastructure support, with an emphasis on practical application
        rather than theoretical experimentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through my coursework and projects, I have explored how AI‑enabled tools can enhance risk analysis,
        optimize lifecycle costs, and support more reliable project delivery. I am particularly interested in
        bridging traditional construction practices with emerging digital technologies to create measurable
        improvements in productivity and asset performance.

      <h2>Professional Experience Highlights</h2>
      <p>
        My experience includes roles in both public infrastructure and private construction services. I have
        supported roadway and permitting operations with the North Carolina Department of Transportation,
        assisted in project estimating and scheduling for commercial and residential work, and completed
        academic projects focused on facilities cost estimation and BIM‑based scheduling.
      </p>
      <p>
        These experiences have shaped my interest in using structured analysis and emerging technologies
        to support better planning, coordination, and execution throughout the project lifecycle.

      <h2>Portfolio Overview</h2>
      <p>
        This website presents a curated portfolio of academic and applied work completed
        as part of the <strong>AI in Construction and Facilities Management</strong> course.
        The projects and analyses showcased here focus on practical applications of
        artificial intelligence, structured decision-making, and data analytics within
        construction and facilities engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than treating AI as a purely theoretical concept, this portfolio emphasizes
        real-world use cases such as bid evaluation, risk analysis, lifecycle planning, and
        facilities maintenance strategy.
